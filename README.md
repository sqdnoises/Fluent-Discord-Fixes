# Fluent Discord Fixes
Making my own fixes for this theme I love\
Just download the [`Fluent-Discord-fixed.css`](Fluent-Discord-fixed.css) file and place it in your themes folder.

All credit goes to [TakosThings](https://github.com/TakosThings) for making the [Fluent Discord Theme](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord).
