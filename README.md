# Fluent Discord Fixes
Making my own fixes for this theme I love\
Just download the [`Fluent-Discord-fixed.css`](Fluent-Discord-fixed.css) file (or download from [Releases](https://github.com/sqdnoises/Fluent-Discord-Fixes/releases)) and place it in your themes folder.

I don't have good knowledge in CSS,\
But I tried to fix whatever was wrong myself.\
This fix fixes some vencord mods and mostly transparency issues with the theme.\
If you want more fixes, DM me on Discord: `@sqd.`.

All credit goes to [TakosThings](https://github.com/TakosThings) for making the [Fluent Discord Theme](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord).
